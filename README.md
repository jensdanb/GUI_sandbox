# GUI_sandbox

Built on Python 3.9.5 and Kivy 2.0.0

# How to try the program yourself
In the future I will make a .exe file that you can just download and click to run. 
If you're familiar with Git you already know how to clone and run this. If you don't, and don't want to learn that way right now, you can follow these steps and instructions: 

1) Download and install Python plus an IDE. 
2) Create a project folder with a Python "Virtual Environment" (also known as 'venv') in it. 

This tutorial video shows a way to do steps 1 and 2 with the Pycharm IDE. Start at 1:50 into the video, and stop at 6:10. https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?t=110

3) Install the kivy package. 

In Pycharm, do this by opening the "Terminal" tab in the bottom of the screen. In Terminal, type "pip install kivy" and press enter. Python will automagically install kivy to your project without touching anything else on your computer. 

4) Copy my project files into yours. 

In Pycharm on the left side is the "Project" folder, which contains "venv" and maybe a file that ends with ".py". Right click on one of the folders, or on "main.py" if it exists, and choose Open In -> Explorer (if you are on Linux; Open In -> Files). 
It should show you the folder that Pycharm made for your project, with a folder inside it called "venv" and maybe a "main.py" file next to it. Python itself and any extra tools (such as Kivy) are inside the venv folder, while other files next to venv are the ones you can create and edit to make a computer program with Python. Download my files from this website and copy them into the project folder, next to the venv folder. For Pong, you need the files "pong game.py" and "pong.kv". 

5) Press run. 

In Pycharm you should see the files appeared on the left side after copying them into the project folder. Double click a file to show it in the main screen. Right click somewhere in the main screen and choose the "Run" option to run the currently open file as a Python program. For Pong, you need to run the file "pong game.py" and have "pong.kv" in the project folder. 

If anything didn't work, send me a message :)
