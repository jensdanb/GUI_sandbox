# GUI_sandbox

Built on Python 3.9.5 and Kivy 2.0.0

# How to download and try my code
In the future I will make a .exe file that you can just download and click to run. 
If you're familiar with Git you already know how to clone and run this. If you don't, and don't want to learn that way right now, you can follow these steps and instructions: 

1) Download and install Python plus an IDE. 
2) Create a project folder and a Python "Virtual Environment" in it. 

This tutorial video shows a way to do steps 1 and 2. Start at 1:50 into the video, and stop at 6:10. https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?t=110

3) Install the kivy package to the project. 

In Pycharm, do this by opening the "Terminal" tab in the bottom of the screen. In Terminal, type "pip install kivy" and press enter. 

4) Copy my project files into yours. 

In Pycharm on the left side is the "Project" files. Right click on one, for example on "main.py" and choose Open In -> Explorer (assuming you are on Windows). It should show you the folder that Pycharm made for your project, with a folder inside it called "venv" and one or more other files. Inside venv are the tools such as Python and Kivy that the project uses, the other files are the ones you can use to make a computer program. Download my files from this website and copy them into this folder (not inside venv!). 

5) Press run. 

In Pycharm you should now see the files appeared on the left side. Double click the new ones so you can see them in the main screen. Right click somewhere in the middle of the file you want to run, and choose "Run" with the green triangle. To play Pong, you want to run the "pong game.py" file. 

If anything didn't work, send me a message :)
