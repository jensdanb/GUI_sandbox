# GUI_sandbox

Built on Python 3.9.5 and Kivy 2.0.0

# How to try the program yourself
In the future I will make a .exe file that you can just download and click to run. 
If you're familiar with Git you already know how to clone and run this. If you don't, and don't want to learn that way right now, you can follow these steps and instructions: 

1) Download and install Python plus an IDE. 
2) Create a project folder with a Python "Virtual Environment" (also known as 'venv') in it. 

This tutorial video shows a way to do steps 1 and 2 with the Pycharm IDE. Start at 1:50 into the video, and stop at 6:10. https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?t=110

3) Install the kivy package. 

In Pycharm, do this by opening the "Terminal" tab in the bottom of the screen. In Terminal, type "pip install kivy" and press enter. Python will automagically install kivy to your project without touching anything else on your computer. 

4) Copy my project files into yours. 

In Pycharm on the left side is the "Project" folder, which contains "venv" and maybe a file that ends with ".py". Right click on one of the folders, or on "main.py" if it exists and choose Open In -> Explorer (assuming you are on Windows). It should show you the folder that Pycharm made for your project, with a folder inside it called "venv" and maybe some other files. Inside venv are the tools such as Python and Kivy that the project uses, the other files are the ones you can use to make a computer program. Download my files from this website and copy them into the project folder, next to the venv folder. For Pong, you need "pong game.py" and "pong.kv". 

5) Press run. 

In Pycharm you should now see the files appeared on the left side. Double click the new ones so you can see them in the main screen. Right click somewhere in the middle of the file you want to run, and choose "Run" with the green triangle. To play Pong, run the "pong game.py" file. 

If anything didn't work, send me a message :)
